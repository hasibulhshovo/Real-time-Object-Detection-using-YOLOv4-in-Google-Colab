# Real-time Object Detection using YOLOv4 in Google Colab

## Description:
This is a Real-time Object Detection system. I have used YOLOv4 for this. You can easily detect objects by capturing an image or live.

## How to use:
If you want to use it in Google Colab then open [`Real_time_Object_Detection_using_YOLOv4_in_Google_Colab.ipynb`](https://github.com/iam-hasibul/Real-time-Object-Detection-using-YOLOv4-in-Google-Colab/blob/main/Real_time_Object_Detection_using_YOLOv4_in_Google_Colab.ipynb)
